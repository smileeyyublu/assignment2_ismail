<h1> Assignment 2 </h1>
<h3> Creating a simple crud application. </h3>

Dear students,

In this assignment, you need to submit your Spring Boot application similar to what we practiced in class. It requires additional reading and practicing. The requirements are simple:

<h4> Task related: (80%) </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create two entities (use different entities than those used in class). <strong>Note:</strong> these entities should have either one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.</li>
  <li>Use H2 Database to store the data (make sure you add some records before launching the application).</li>
  <li>Enable the user to do operations like Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete (e.g., create a new user, list all users, update an existing user, delete a user).</li>
  <li>Use your design knowledge from WM1 to enhance the project with CSS files.</li>
  <li>Write additional @Query (non-native)</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (20%) </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create Add/Remove for the cross-relationship (like removal or addition of courses for the Student).</li>
  <li>Write native queries with some advanced SQL.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Submission related: </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you configured your git client (i.e., username and email is set). Use firstname_lastname as the username. </li>
  <li> Please, also ensure that you regularly check, add and commit your changes to the remote repo so that we can see your progress. </li>
</ul>

This assignment will give you <strong>30%</strong> of the total. <br />
<em> Good luck! </em> <br />
